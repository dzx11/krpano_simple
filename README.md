This is a subset of krpano that removes advanced features, and adds a simple drag-and-drop interface. Simply choose a panoramic image,
and it will be converted into VR-friendly, scrollable dynamic content for your application. Currently, only Chrome 49 or later is supported.
For testing, may I suggest the krpano testing server (https://krpano.com/tools/ktestingserver/).
